# CADTOOL project docs

This repository is documented in two primary engineering references:

- project brief and scope: [PROJECT.md](https://github.com/KingstonSigns/CADTOOL/blob/main/PROJECT.md)
- technical architecture and runtime behavior: [TECHNICAL.md](https://github.com/KingstonSigns/CADTOOL/blob/main/TECHNICAL.md)

These are intended for systems engineers and contain the authoritative design and implementation details.
