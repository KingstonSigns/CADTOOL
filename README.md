# Web Three Interface

A browser-based 3d configurator for signage panels. It lets you set panel dimensions, add up to four front-face images with layout and margin controls, preview the result in a cad-style three js scene, and export an stl plus images and metadata in a zip. A backend scaffold is included for future storage and processing.
